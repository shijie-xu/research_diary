#### [PDA: Semantically Secure Time-Series Data Analytics with Dynamic Subgroups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6198.pdf)

- Background & previous works
  - various needs for sharing data, which contains sensitive info
  - previous works focus on data anonymization
  - restrict the usage of published data

- Design goals
  - Time-series data, Communication & Computation overhead
  - Channel security
  - Privacy-requirement independent accuracy
- this paper, a cryptographic tool PDA:
  - capable for any data analysis based on **polynomial**
  - secure against CPA in Dolev-Yao network model
  - small communication overhead, comparable with the peer works who present ah-hoc solutions specifically. 

#### Preliminaries & Definitions & Achieving

- $k$-DDH problem, $N$-th residue, discrete logarithm $\log_{1+N}\pmod{N^2}$, DCR problem
- Lemm2: DDH$\le_P$ $k$-DDH
- Setup -> KeyGen -> Encode -> Aggregate
- Correctness of PDA: formalized with prob. 
- Security of PDA: Data publishing game
- Construction (more details in the paper)
- **Dynamic User Group**, Examples

#### Correctness & Security 

- **Indistinguishable**: Lemma 6-8
- Theorem 2
- $\kappa$ controls the actual size of encode value, which didn't explained aforementioned

Questions & Notes:

- IND-CPA is equivalent to the semantic security under CPA, [paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1984-jcss.pdf)
