#### [SmartAuth: User-Centered Authorization for the Internet of Things](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-tian.pdf)

- present a new design that supports user-centric, semantic-based "smart" authorization (SmartAuth) to minimize the gap between expectations of users' and the apps' true functionality
- prior work on permissions systems for mobile apps has repeatedly documented that users often fail to act permission screens
- **privacy is context-sensitive**

#### Background

- home automation systems
- NLP(Word2Vec) technologies
- previous IoT research studied two types of overprivilege: coarse capability & device-app binding
- remote access is also an important security risk

#### Design

- design goals: 
  - the system would minimize the privilege to IoT apps
  - the authorization system should be human-centric(minimize the burden on users)
  - lightweight, compatible and IoT-specific
- automatically discovering app behaviors -> analyzing app descriptions 
  - parse code to create AST, covers an app's direct access to IoT devices
  - use NLP techniques to extract the security policy from the app's free-text description and program analysis to compare with the security policy extracted from the code

- authorization interface generation  and policy enforcement
