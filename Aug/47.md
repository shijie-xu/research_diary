#### [Speechless: Analyzing the Threat to Speech Privacy from Smartphone Motion Sensors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8418650)

- **revisit** the important line research and closely inspect the effect of speech on smartphone motion sensors
  - shares a common surface with a loudspeaker
  - extend the previous work by analyzing the effect of speech
- human-rendered speech seems potentially incapacitated to trigger smartphone motion sensors
- machine-rendered speech may not be powerful enough to affect smartphone motion sensors

#### Background

- the use of motion sensors as a microphone to pick up speech signals was first reported by Michalevsky et al.
- accelerometer readings could be affected by speech
- MEMS accelerometer: measure gravity and dynamic acceleration such as motion and vibrations

#### Contributions

- Preliminaries
  - machine-rendered speech and human speech
  - signal analysis methodology
  - sensor behavior under quiet conditions
  - sensor behavior against speech signals
- motion sensors vs. loudspeaker
  - frequency domain analysis
  - time domain analysis
- motion sensors vs. laptop speaks
- motion sensors vs. human speech
