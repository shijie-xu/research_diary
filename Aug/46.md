#### [Crowd-GPS-Sec: Leveraging Crowdsourcing to Detect and Localize GPS Spoofing Attacks](http://www.lenders.ch/publications/conferences/sp18_2.pdf)
- detect and localize GPS spoofing attacks on moving airborne targets
- requires neither any updates of the GPS infrastructure nor of the airborne GPS receivers

#### Background

- the GPS system is not secure, i.e. GPS signals sent by the satellites are neither authenticated nor encrypted
- the price to perform GPS spoofing attacks has dramatically dropped
- GPS spoofing attacks: exploit the lack of encryption and authentication of civilian GPS signals, spoofing attacks are based on fake GPS signals manipulating the ToAs of signals
- threats model
- GPS spoofing coverage estimation: $L_{fs} = 32.45 + 20 \log_{10}(d_{km}) + 20 \log_{10}(f_{MHz})$

#### Contribution

- Crowd-GPS-Sec. relies on crowdsourcing to monitor those messages at global scale
- goal: to detect GPS spoofing attacks on aerial vehicles as quickly as possible and to localize the position of the spoofers
- Multilateration(MLAT)
  - in regions with high sensor density position advertisement messages are received by multiple geographically distributed sensors, hence propagation distances of the transmitted signals differ
- GPS spoofing detection
- GPS spoofer localization
  - if a malicious device emits GPS spoofing signals, aircraft within the effective range will broadcast spoofed positions
  - identification of the currently spoofed aircraft: $dist(a_i,SP) - dist(a_j , SP) = d_{i,j}\cdot \frac{c}{v_{track}}$
