#### [IoT Goes Nuclear: Creating a ZigBee Chain Reaction](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1047.pdf)

- a new type thread: the worm spreads by jumping directly from on lamp to its neighbors by built-in ZigBee wireless
- side channel attack to extract the global AES-CCM key

- much stronger than all of the previously 

  - A correlation power analysis(CPA) attack against the CCM mode used to encrypt and verify firmware updates
  - a take over attack allowing us to full control over lamps from long distances without using custom hardware
- advantages: 

  - it does not assume any knowledge
  - works with **any type** of counter implementation
  - it does not require any valid encryption sample
  - requires at most the verification of messages as short as 2 blocks
  - require at most twice the number of traces required to break ECB mode
- Percolation theory
- give users wireless control over lamps either from a remote or from a smart-phone application using a gateway

#### Attack

- ZLL experimental setup: create an experimental setup that allows to send and receive ZLL messages etc.
- attack scenario: a worm can automatically spread among physically adjacent lamps in chain reaction
  - differential power analysis(DPA); 
  - correlation power analysis(CPA)
  - Philips OTA image cryptographic primitives
- we introduce a novel method of efficiently converting most chosen plaintext CPA attack against ECB mode
