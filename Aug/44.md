#### [Global-Scale Secure Multiparty Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/189.pdf)

- 3-party computation: 700x improvement, general n-party improvement; scalability: very large number (128 parties AES)
- in this paper, an **unbounded number** of  malicious corruptions is tolerated

- Constant-round MPC
  - FairplayMP: implemented in the semi-honest setting
  - many others are **not implemented**
  - concurrent work: Hazay et al.

- Existing work of Wang et al.: 2-party authenticated garbling
- multiparity setting
  - if n-1 garblers are corrupt, there is no guarantee about the correctness of the garbled circuit they generate.
  - protocols based on BMR that are maliciously secure against corruption of n-1 parties require either O(n) somewhat homomorphic encryptions or O(n) SPDZ multiplication subprotocols
  - multiparty Tiny OT style: BDOZ, SPDZ

#### Contribution

- complete MPC protocols
  - Circuit pre-scan -> Circuit Garbling -> Circuit Input Processing -> Circuit Evaluation -> Circuit Output Processing
- Efficiently realizing $\mathcal{F}_{PRE}$
  - our protocol also relies on two-party $\mathcal{F}_{aBit}$ functionality
  - multi-party authenticated shares: a straightforward idea is to call $\mathcal{F}_{aBit}^n$ n times
  - first let all parties compute l+p number of multi-party authenticated shares, then partially open the last p tuples to check the consistency of global MAC keys
  - $\mathcal{F}_{HaAND}$: takes unauthenticated and potentially inconsistent y's and outputs authenticated share <x> 
  - multi-party leaky authenticated AND triple
- Correctness and Unforgeability

#### Implementation

- implemented under EMP-toolkit framework
  - LAN setting: machines are located in the same Amazon EC2 region, experiments are performed for up to 14 parties
  - WAN setting: each machine is located in a **different** Amazon EC2 region
  - Crowd setting: in LAN case, 128 parties all located in the same Amazon EC2 region
