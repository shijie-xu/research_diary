

#### Contributions

- a unified IoT architecture based on a future Internet infrastructure with the focus on a newly introduced component IoT middleware
- investigate the vulnerabilities of the existing IoT systems
- propose a delegation-based 3-party key management protocol

#### Evolution of IoT Architecture

- "silo" solutions -- integrated vertically-- conflicts with the open spirit of the Internet
- overlay-based IoT architecture -- unified IoT solutions --still has several weakness
- introduce an abstract middleware layer to enable object virtualization
- **General Security Analysis**
  - Authentication and physical threats, integrity, confidentiality, privacy
- Mobility-based
  - NCRS: centered the concept of "flat" security-based GUIDs
- with the constraints of low-device, it cannot afford to perform **asymmetric** operations
