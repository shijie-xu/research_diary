- **A Vehicle-based Edge Computing Platform for Transit and Human Mobility Analytics**
  - this paper proposed a new low-cost, wireless-based mechanism to conduct spatial-temporal public transit analytics
  - the key idea is relies on the fact that many mobile device typically have their Wi-Fi function turned on; obviously it cannot count for passengers who travel without mobile devices or those with their Wi-Fi function turn off
- **An Empirical Study of Latency in an Emerging Class of Edge Computing Applications for Wearable Cognitive Assistance**
  - this paper design seven applications and evaluate their performance to obtain an empirical understanding of end-to-end latency in an emerging class of edge computing applications
- **An Energy-efficient Offloading Framework with Predictable Temporal Correctness**
  - computation offloading: leverage powerful remote resources by offloading complex computations to the remote site
  - existing solutions cannot be applied because they separately consider the two performance aspects(either energy or timing predictability)
- **CloudPath: A Multi-Tier Cloud Computing Framework** √
  - this paper introduces a generalization of edge computing into a multi-tier cloud paradigm
  - CloudPath is based on the key observation that RESTful stateless functionality decomposition is made possible by the existence of a common storage layer
- **Demo Abstract: A Smart Building System Integrated with An Edge Computing Algorithm and IoT Mesh Networks**
  - create a smart building system as a case study, capable of sensoring surrounding environment
  - use IoT Mesh solution to establish an IoT network
- **Edge Computing in the ePC - A Reality Check**√
  - this paper shows that not only the assumption that the latency at first aggregation level of **Mobile Edge Computing** is not negligible, but dominated the end-to-end latency
- **Workload Management for Dynamic Mobile Clusters in Edge Femtoclouds**
  - this paper addresses the full requirements of workload management in Femotoclouds
  - What is *femto cloud*?
- **Towards Efficient Edge Cloud Augmentation for Virtual Reality MMOGs**
