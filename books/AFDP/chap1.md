#### The Promise of Differential Privacy

- The Fundamental Law of Information Recovery states that overly accurate answers to two many questions will destroy privacy in a spectacular way, the goal of differential privacy algorithm is to postpone this inevitability.
- Differential privacy addresses the paradox of learning nothing about an individual while learning useful information about a population.
- It's a definition not an algorithm.

##### Privacy-preserving data analysis

- Data cannot be fully anonymized and remain useful.
- Re-identification of "anonymized" records is not the only risk.
- Queries over large sets are not protection.
- Queries auditing is problematic.
- Summary statistics are not "safe".
- "Ordinary" facts are not "OK".
- "Just a few".
