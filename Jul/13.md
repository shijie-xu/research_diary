#### [Leakage-Abuse Attacks against Order-Revealing Encryption ](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/433.pdf)

#### Our work

- new leakage-abuse attacks that recover plaintexts from database: cast as a non-crossing bipartite matching problem
- revisit NKW attack, which works against any scheme that reveals plaintext frequency and order, low accuracy & relatively slow
- the most widely used scheme(BCLO) is not secure, for a uniformly chosen plaintext, the corresponding ciphertext leaks almost the entire first half of the plaintext
- exploit the leakage of the more recent CLWW, which provides an equivalently poor level of security as compared to BCLO
- first to explore the security of OPE & ORE when used with plaintext data types

#### Background

- Order-preserving encryption(OPE) ensures $\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)<\mathcal{E}_k(m_2)$ for $m_1<m_2$, here $\mathcal{E}_k$ is the encryption algorithm
- a recent study used some auxiliary info about the distribution of plaintexts, recover many plaintexts

- Order-preserving encryption(OPE): allows encrypting data under a secret key k s.t. $\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)<\mathcal{E}_k(m_2)$ for all $m_1<m_2$;  Oder-revealing encryption(ORE) doesn't allow an existing comparison operator to work on ciphertexts but a public procedure

- PRE-based systems: OPE & ORE are examples of property-revealing encryption (PRE) schemes, which allows limited computation over the revealed plaintext properties; a minimal security requirement is the confidentiality of plaintext data in the face of attackers that obtain access to a PRE-encrypted database
- Types of ORE/OPE schemes: mutable, interactive, requiring multiple rounds of communication between the client and server

#### Overview & Methodology

- customer record as case study:
  - In industry currently OPE is used to encrypt customer records before uploading to cloud services
  -  focus particularly on a subset: first name, last name, US zip code(邮编), birthdate, which benefit from server-side processing that takes advantage of the ability to compare plaintext ordering
  - restrict out attention to male first names, 'cause gender cannot be hidden by any PRE scheme
  - in these context, revealing plaintext order to servers enables a variety of server-side operations: sorting, range queries
- threat model:
  - attacks will target each attribute independently(Cross-column attack in this setting remains an interesting topic for future work)
  - an adversary obtains a sequence $C=(c_1,...,c_n)$ of encryptions of one column of data;the secret key $k$ remains unknown to the attacker; the passive adversary can take advantage of auxiliary info. about the distribution from which plaintexts are drawn
  - stronger adversarial models: a subset of n plaintexts are known by the adversary
  - in all attacks the adversary finishes by outputting a list of n ciphertext, plaintext pairs, whose success is measured in several ways
- data sets

#### The Non-Crossing Attack

- attack setting: an attacker obtains a sequence of  ciphertexts $C=(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$, for $c_i=\mathcal{E}_K(m_i)$, auxiliary info $Z=(z_1,\ldots,z_\psi)$, here $n<\psi$, the attacker outputs a guess of each ciphertexts' plaintexts, measure success as per the tree recovery rate types defined in the previous section
- NKW attacks: against schemes which leak order & frequency; it's simpler to cast the problem NKW solves in the language of graph algorithms
  - let G=(U,V,E) be a bipartite graph, here U-ciphertext vertex, V-plaintext vertex, n=|U|,$\psi=|V|$
  - e=(u,v) is labeled according to a cost, $w(i,j)=|H_C(i)-H_Z(j)|^2+|F_C(i)-F_Z(j)|^2$, here H and F are as in Section II
  - attacker seeks a minimal-cost bipartite matching; we use Hungarian algorithm($O(\psi^3)$)
- Limitations of the cumulative attack
  - The performance of attack is prohibitive for large dataset
  - the NKW attack violated ordering constraints in every one of our experiments on real datasets
- The non-crossing attack
  - avoid crossings in their solution by solving a max-weight non-crossing bipartite matching problem on the graph
  - improving computational performance significantly over NKW, $O(n\psi)$
- Results

#### Attacking the BCLO Scheme

- schemes leak only frequency or order information are not deployed in any real-world systems because they require either inefficient multilinear maps or client state, mutable ciphertexts, or multiple rounds of communication
- BCLO is secure in the sense of being indistinguishable from a random order-preserving function(ROPF), which still may leak significant info. about the plaintext; we will explore how this leakage affects security for in our running case study
- The problem of padding: variable-length inputs represent a trickier problem than for other types of encryption; this is painful when it comes to security of schemes like BCLO: the padding pushes sensitive data into those bits that are leaked; in our experiments, we encoded first and last names as base-27 integers, space character is the smallest one
- BCLO's additional leakage(????)
  - Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the message space with size $M=|\mathcal{M}|$, let ciphertext space be $\mathcal{C}=\{1,...,C\}$, sets $\log C=3+\log M$, $m_c=[\frac{M\cdot c}{C+1}],\delta = \frac{b}{2\sqrt{M-1}}$
  - a window of size up to $2\delta$ can be drawn constrains the plaintext with high prob., making the window smaller slightly increase the leakage and helps reduce the overlap
- Abusing just the BCLO leakage
  - this approach doesn't require any auxiliary data, and requires just a few elementary computations for each ciphertext
  - this heuristic performs quite well particularly for last names
  - in the case of fixed input length plaintexts (e.g. ZIP code), there is no need for padding, it's impossible to exactly recover any plaintexts using the heuristic above
- Inference attack with BCLO leakage
  - let G=(U,V,E) be a bipartite graph where every vertex in U corresponds to a unique ciphertext in C and vertices in V correspond to unique auxiliary data
  - for fixed-length inputs we run the inference as describe above, for variable-length data such as first names and last names, we first run our heuristic attack, and then run the inference attack when the former failed
- Inference attack result

#### Attacking The CLWW Schemes

- The CLWW schemes: leaks less than BCLO for uniform messages: for only one ciphertext their scheme is semantically secure, for n revealed ciphertexts of length k, the prob. more than log k bits leak is negligible.
- The CLWW attack: Because the scheme leaks the index of the first bit that differs between two ciphertexts and the ordering of their underlying plaintexts, it also leaks the value of the plaintext bit at that index
- CLWW attack results, Composed OPE & ORE(?????)
- Decompose attack result

#### Known-Plaintext Attacks

- adversarial capabilities in practice: a typical practice gives rise to the ability to mount chosen plaintext attacks; this attack can trivially recover every plaintext from any message distribution 
- the partitioning attack can be used against any scheme that leaks at least frequency and order
- Results

#### Attacking Frequency-hiding schemes

- we seek to analyze security of schemes that only leak order, a simple attack that targets high-frequency elements of a distribution by estimating where the ciphertexts of those elements are relative to the others
- since frequency is not leaked, we need to find the range of ciphertexts which are all encryptions of the same underlying plaintext, 
  - the encryptions of $z_i$ is a contiguous sub-list of C, we need to find the first and last indices, denoted l and u
  - we can estimate the upper bound given the lower bound; we need to estimate the lower bound
- Hoeffding's inequality: for n i.i.d. tosses of a coin which returns heads with prob. $p$, for any $\epsilon>0$, the number of head H(n) obeys the inequality $Pr[(p-\epsilon)n\le H(n)\le(p+\epsilon)n]\ge 1-2e^{-2\epsilon^2 n}$
- Results: for all experiments we computed the interval width $\epsilon$ using condifdence d=0.99, our prefix recovery rate was 37% for birthdates, 12% for ZIP(its distribution is closer to uniform than the others); average recovery rate was 86% for the top 10 first name, 76% for the last name...
