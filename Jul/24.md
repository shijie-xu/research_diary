#### [Poster: Locally Differentially Private Frequent Itemset Mining](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/poster-abstracts/oakland2018-paper42-poster-abstract.pdf)

We propose Set-Value Item Mining(SVIM) protocol to handle set values under the LDP with better accuracy and same privacy constraints:

- use FSFO with a small l to report, aggregator sends candidates to users
- use FO to report the number of candidate items, aggregator sends appropriate l to users
- use FSFO with the given l to report, aggregator estimates the frequency
- aggregator selects top k frequent items

Because this is just a poster, I read some paper more, I'm confused that what is the main contribution of this paper? There are 4 phases in **SVIM** protocol, while the protocol **LDPMiner** in following paper just 2:
