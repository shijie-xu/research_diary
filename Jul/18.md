#### [Differential Privacy as a Mutual Information Constraint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03677)

This paper give a connection between differential privacy and mutual information(MI), moreover, they are **equivalent**, and the following inequality chain is proved:

> ε-DP>=KL-DP>=MI-DP>=(δ)-DP>=(ε,δ)-DP

Base on the related work, we know KL-DP>=MI-DP. In this paper, the authors give an connection between 

- KL-DP and ε-DP
- MI-DP and (ε,δ)-DP

This paper is a theoretical result, reveals what is the differential privacy with respect to the mutual information constraint. Besides the part of proof of main theorem, some of differential privacy (e.g. Personalized DP, Bayesian DP) have been redefined in a point of view of MI-DP.

MI-DP is a well-understood quantity, which provides a clear picture of DP. In this point, several properties of DP can be proved immediately. Also many DP questions can be thought in a point of view of MI, this may be the most valuable contribution of this paper.
