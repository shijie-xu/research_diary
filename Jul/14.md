#### [A Framework for Universally Composable Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/324.pdf)

#### Background & our work

- some first steps have been taken to get rid of reduction proofs for real-world key exchange protocols
- base on the work by Küsters and Tuengerthal, provide an ideal functionality in the universal composability setting
- a new general ideal key exchange functionality
- application to three practical DH key exchange protocols: ISO 9798-3, SIGMA, OPTLS
- many approaches strive to achieve some kind of modularity in order to tame the complexity, but security proof are typically still very bad, due to every protocol has to carry out reduction proofs again
- main idea: a real protocol P' may use an ideal functionality F as a subroutine to perform its task, typically one shows that P' realizes another (high-level) ideal functionality F'
- main contribution: 
  - extend the ideal functionality from previous work

#### The IITM Model

- general ideal behind universal composability: real protocol should be at least as secure as the ideal one
- IITM(Inexhaustible Interactive Turing Machine): the systems P and Q are called indistinguishable if difference between the prob. P outputs 1 and Q outputs 1 is negligible
- Simulation-based security: P realizes F if there exists a adversarial system S s.t. P and S|F have the same external interface, and for all environment E,$E|P=E|S|F^2$
- Composition Theorem allows one to analyze a single session of a protocol in isolation in order to conclude security of an unbounded number of sessions

#### Ideal Functionality

- **ideal functionality** $F_{crypto}$ allows its users to perform the following operations in an ideal way:
  - generate symmetric keys
  - generate public/private keys
  - derive symmetric keys from other symmetric keys
  - encrypt and decrypt
  - compute and verify MACs and digital signatures
  - generate fresh nonces
- $F_{crypto}$ is a machine with n I/O tapes, representing different roles in a higher level protocol, and a network tape
- user (pid,lsid,r), which pid is a party identifier, lsid is a local session identifier, r is the role/tape, has some commands
- diffie-hellman KE: we extend the protocol to support DHKE, parametrize $F_{crypto}$ with a $GroupGen(1^\eta)$ algorithm that used to generate the DH group, then we have more additional commands

#### Realization

- a realization $P_{crypto}$ of $F_{crypto}$: $(\Sigma_{authenc},\Sigma_{unauthenc},\Sigma_{pub})$ for (un-)authenticated symmetric and public key encryption, a Mac scheme $\Sigma_{MAC}$, algorithm $GroupGen(\eta)$, two families of pseudo-random functions (PRF)
- DH related commands: 
  - get generated group
  - mark group element as used
  - retrieve an exponent
  - generate a new diffie-hellman key
- Theorem 2: L is a leakage algorithm, then $F^*|P_{crypto}\le_R F^*|F_{crypto}$ if $\Sigma_{unauth-enc}$ and $\Sigma_{pub}$ are IND-CCA2 secure, $\Sigma_{auth-enc}$ is IND-CPA & IND-CTXT secure, $\Sigma_{mac}$ and $\Sigma_{sig}$ are UF-CMA secure, GroupGen always outputs groups with n>=2 and s.t. DDH assumption

#### Ideal Functionalities & Case Studies

- Ideal functionalities
  - $F_{key-use}^{MA}$	guarantees that an uncorrupted instance
  - $F_{key-use}^{UA}$ is similar but models unilateral authentication of the responder only
- ISO protocol: a straightforward use of our framework
- SIGMA protocol: model it analogously to the ISO protocol, use unauthenticated encryption to encrypt message due to authenticated is unnecessary
- OPTLS:  model it in the same way as the ISO and SIGMA protocols
